===========

Author: Joel Kemp, @mrjoelkemp

Tech Used: Coffeescript, Underscore.js, Jquery UI, HTML5 Local Storage, HAML/SASS, and Head.js.

## Notes
The app only supports Create and Delete operations. To update, you must delete the task and create a new one.

Upon completion of a task, simply delete it.

## Future Ideas
Completed tasks should be archived into a different UI element or use a strikethrough and add it to the bottom of the task list.
