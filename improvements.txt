Completed tasks:

Feature Changes
Completed tasks should be archived into a different list (Completed Tasks)
	- Single click to mark completed
	- create CSS class containing the strikethrough 
	- Detach it and reattach it to the task list Should be attached at the end.
	- Need additional field (completed) so that we can load tasks that are completed with the strikethrough

	-flash the textbar as red if the task is not valid.

Storage Changes:
Make local storage work on Firefox
Use Modernizr to detect localstorage
Change backend from localstorage to redis or mongo server?

Visual Changes:
Make task items auto-width
	-Need to wrap in 100% width container to retain vertical arrangement.
	-Might be another way to set a vertical property of the UL

Add pointer cursor for items. Give it a hand to drag.
Make the UI resilient to width changes. Either force a width or use percentages.

Hide the tasklist at the start. It currently shows when the list is empty.
	- when a task is being inserted, show the tasklist and the title

If you delete all of the tasks, hide the title.
	-Upon task deletion, check the number of children in the UL task list.
		-If it's zero, then the list is empty
			-hide the title
			-hide the taskList

Find a complementary color to add a visual pop to the gray, black, and white aesthetic
	-Make half of the title pop
	-Maybe make the verbs in the instructions pop. (Drag, enter, doubleclick)

Create a count of the tasks near the "Current Tasks:" label.
