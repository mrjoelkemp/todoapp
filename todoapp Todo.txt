Implementation----
On sort event end, 
Determine the ranks of your top neighbor
-if top neighbor is undefined, your rank is 1
-if bottom neighbor is undefined, your rank is the largest known rank (doesn't apply since we're looking at top neighbor)
-Update the todo's rank in local storage

Local storage schema (key/value)
Id to Todo Object mapping
Todo Object
-id
-ul object
-rank

TodoManager : could be cumbersome
CreateTodo()
UpdateTodo
DeleteTodo


On dom load,
	Make todos div/ul sortable
	Check local storage for our todo db
	If exists, try to pull the todos
		-if todos exist, for each todo:
			-create an <li> and attach to todos
			-set li's data for id
			-set li data for rank
